5 01-level data files are scraped from Wikipedia:

* `series` [key: series]
* `episodes` [key: series, episode]
* `bakers` [keys: series, baker]
* `challenges` [key: series, episode, baker]
* `results` [key: series, episode, baker]


1 02-level data file is made by merging other 01-level data files:

* `challenge_results` = `results` + `challenges 
  - `Joining, by = c("series", "episode", "baker")`
  
1 03-level data file is made by merging an 01-level and 02-level data file:
* `baker_results` = `bakers` + `challenge_results`
  - significant wrangling using `dplyr::group_by(series, baker)` + `dplyr::summarize`
  - `Joining, by = c("series", "baker")`


For DataCamp:

* `results_wide`: spreads result by episode
* `challenge_results_extra`: includes extra row of metadata
