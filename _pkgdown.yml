      Tibbles with data from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Bake_Off),
      followed by minimal taming using the [`fivethirtyeight` R data package guidelines](https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.com/articles/fivethirtyeight.html#guidelines).
      All variable types are cast properly, all tibbles are in tidy format, and all variable names are in `snake_case`.
